HARDWARE:

Hardware is designed with gEDA suite (http://www.geda.seul.org/). 
All sources are available in "<xarias_root>/schematics/" directory.  
You can find particular boards schematics in 
"<xarias_root>/schematics/bXX/" directories ('b' comes from "board"). 
For details of specific board please see 
"<xarias_root>/schematics/bXX/readme" file.

XARIAS project is not the single board. As the project develops new
boards are designed. They are different from each other and probably 
they will be designed for different applications. As a result each
single board is stored in different bXX directory, where XX is the 
number of the board.

WARNING: please take a note, that you should edit 
"<xarias_root>/schematics/bXX/gafrc" to point correctly to your
"<xarias_root>/schematics/symbols" directory.


FIRMWARE:

To be able to compile the firmware you need to have installed 
avr-gcc cross-compiler and avr-libc libraries. For more information
please refer to http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/
and http://www.avrfreaks.net/wiki/index.php/Documentation:AVR_GCC
