This hardware (widely known as carputer) is developed to allow 
you to get lots of useful information about your car. 


Version v0.1 is capable of the following:
 - momentary and average speed measurement
 - time of the journey
 - momentary and average fuel consumption
 - passed distance


XARIAS could easily be adapted to use in every gasoline powered
car with electronically controlled injection time. This 
version was tested on Toyota Corolla EEA100 (E10) with 4EFE
engine. This engine has 4 injectors connected paralelly.
It means, that one impulse open all 4 injectors at the time. 
The time of opening is measured on "Injector" input and 
multiplied by 4 to get correct result. If your engine has 
separately connected injectors you have two solutions. 

The first, and the easiest one, is to measure the time of opening 
only on one of them and then multiply it by 4, as opening times 
are very similiar on different valves at the same small period 
of time. 

The second is to make as much inputs as you have injectors and 
calculate opening time on each of them. This option is not supported 
by XARIAS at the moment.
